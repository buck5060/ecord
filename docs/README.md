# E-CORD Profile

This repository is intended to host the E-CORD documentation, XOS Models definitions and XOS GUI Extensions that are horizontal to the profile and not tied to a single service.

It contains an overview of E-CORD and an installation guide that outlines step by step how to deploy an end to end E-CORD solution.

It contains models and GUIs for both `ecord-local` and `ecord-global` profiles.
